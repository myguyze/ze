## Purpose

Salience is the single highest-risk part of proactive correlation. Without it the graph
floods with noise and Ze becomes a spam/conspiracy generator. This phase defines, in one
place:

1. **Where signals come from** and how an item earns a place in the graph (admission).
2. **What "the user cares about"** means, computed from memory — the *relevance set*.
3. **The bar** an item or a hypothesis must clear before it costs the user attention.

The design principle: salience is **grounded in the user, not in the world**. An item is
salient because it touches what the user has shown they care about (profile, preferences,
goals, conversations, engagement) — or because its intrinsic magnitude is high enough that
ignoring it would be negligent. This is the bounded-relevance principle from the
Correlation Engine ADR, made concrete and computable.

---

## Responsibilities

- Project memory into a **relevance set**: weighted entities and topics the user cares
  about, derived from durable and recent signals.
- Define the **admission gate** that decides whether a raw `Signal` enters the graph
  (Phase 55 calls this before `ingest_signal`).
- Define the **surfacing bar** that decides whether a formed hypothesis (Phase 57) is
  allowed to reach the user — inline (Phase 58) or push (Phase 59, deferred).
- Keep both gates cheap and explainable: every score must decompose into named
  contributions Ze can cite ("relevant because: active goal X, profile interest Y").
- Provide a feedback path so user reactions tune thresholds over time.

---

## Out of Scope

- Anchoring signals into the graph (Phase 55).
- Forming or wording hypotheses (Phase 57).
- A general engagement-telemetry/click-tracking system. Engagement here means coarse,
  already-available signals (follow-up questions, explicit reactions), not pixel tracking.
- Per-user model training or learned rankers. Thresholds are tuned by simple bounded
  feedback, not ML.

---

## The Relevance Set

The relevance set is the user's interest fingerprint: a weighted map of entities and
topics, projected from memory on demand (cached, short TTL).

```python
# core/ze-memory/ze_memory/types.py

@dataclass
class RelevanceEntry:
    key: str                      # entity id or normalized topic
    kind: Literal["entity", "topic"]
    weight: float                 # 0..1
    sources: list[str]            # why: ["profile:topics", "goal:...", "episode:recent"]

@dataclass
class RelevanceSet:
    entries: dict[str, RelevanceEntry]
    built_at: datetime
```

### Sources and base weights

| Source | Signal | Base weight | Decay |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| Profile facets (`topics`, `preferences`) | durable, synthesized | High | none (stable) |
| Explicit preferences (`news_interest`, `topic_interest`) | user stated | High | none |
| Active goals (titles + linked entities) | current projects | Medium | ends with goal |
| Recent episode entities | conversation in last N days | Medium | time decay |
| Engagement (follow-ups, reactions to prior pushes) | demonstrated interest | Medium→High | slow decay |
| Graph centrality | entity already richly connected in user's graph | Low | none |

Negative preferences (`news_exclusion`, "stop showing X") subtract or zero a key — reusing
the Phase 50 exclusion taxonomy so news and correlation share one notion of "don't care".

```python
# core/ze-memory/ze_memory/relevance.py
class RelevanceModel:
    def __init__(self, memory_store, goal_provider) -> None: ...
    async def build(self) -> RelevanceSet: ...
    def score(self, rset: RelevanceSet, entities: list[str], topics: list[str]) -> RelevanceScore: ...
```

```python
@dataclass
class RelevanceScore:
    value: float                  # 0..1
    contributions: list[str]      # explainable: matched keys and their weights
```

---

## Gate 1 — Signal Admission (cheap, mostly non-LLM)

Called by Phase 55 before `ingest_signal`. Keeps the graph bounded.

```
admission = w_rel * relevance_to_user + w_mag * intrinsic_magnitude
admit if admission >= τ_admit
```

- `relevance_to_user`: `RelevanceModel.score(signal.entities, signal.topics)`.
- `intrinsic_magnitude`: `signal.magnitude` (source-supplied, per-source normalized so one
  noisy source cannot dominate).
- The LLM is **not** in this path. Admission is vector/lookup math so it can run on every
  fetched item cheaply.

Rationale for the user's question "how does the LLM know what to surface": at ingestion it
mostly does **not** — a cheap relevance computation does. The LLM is reserved for Gate 2 /
correlation, where it is expensive and worth it.

### Admission outcomes

| admission | Outcome |
| --------- | ------- |
| `>= τ_admit` | Ingest as event (Phase 55) |
| `τ_watch <= admission < τ_admit` | Hold in a lightweight watch buffer (no graph write); admit if a later related signal raises combined relevance |
| `< τ_watch` | Drop |

The watch buffer is what lets a *pair* of individually-marginal items become jointly
salient — the mechanism behind "two small events that only matter together".

---

## Gate 2 — Hypothesis Surfacing

The surfacing bar depends on the **delivery surface**, because the cost of being wrong
differs by orders of magnitude. An unprompted push interrupts the user; an inline section
merely enriches an answer they already asked for. There are therefore two bars, and
`τ_inline < τ_push`.

### Inline bar (Phase 58 — low)

Applied when correlation runs during a turn the user initiated. Relevance is implicit (the
user asked about the topic) and there is no interruption, so the bar is minimal:

| Condition | Threshold |
| --------- | --------- |
| Recall guarantee | ≥2 distinct `graph_recall` items (Phase 57) |
| Correlation confidence | `>= τ_inline` (low) |

No novelty or budget gate — re-asking may legitimately re-surface the same connection.

### Push bar (Phase 59 — high, the interrupt bar; deferred post-v1)

Applied by the proactive consumer after a hypothesis is formed. A hypothesis is pushed only
if **all** hold:

| Condition | Threshold | Source |
| --------- | --------- | ------ |
| Recall guarantee | ≥2 distinct `graph_recall` items | Phase 57 |
| Correlation confidence | `>= τ_push` | LLM self-rating, calibrated by feedback |
| Evidence count | `>= 2` grounded items | each with a stable id (`external_ref`/episode id) |
| Relevance to user | `>= τ_rel` | `RelevanceModel.score` over involved entities |
| Novelty | not embedding-similar to a recent push | `PushLogStore` + embedding |
| Push budget | within rate limit | `PushLogStore` window |

If any fails, the hypothesis is stored (for the weekly digest / on-demand recall) but not
pushed. "Worth storing" and "worth interrupting you" are deliberately different bars.

---

## Feedback Loop

Pushes carry lightweight actions (reuse confirmation/action frames): **useful** /
**not relevant** / **mute topic**.

- `useful` on a hypothesis nudges `τ_push`/`τ_rel` (and `τ_inline`) down slightly (more like this).
- `not relevant` nudges them up; repeated on a topic lowers that topic's relevance weight.
- `mute topic` writes a `news_exclusion`-style negative preference (shared taxonomy).

Tuning is bounded (clamped to `[τ_min, τ_max]`) and global in v1, not per-topic learned
models. The point is drift correction, not a recommender.

## Configuration

```yaml
# config/config.yaml
correlation:
  salience:
    dry_run: false             # true → log admission decisions without writing to graph
    admission:
      tau_admit: 0.55
      tau_watch: 0.35
      w_relevance: 0.7
      w_magnitude: 0.3
      watch_buffer_ttl_hours: 48
    surfacing:
      tau_push: 0.6            # interrupt bar (proactive push, Phase 59 — deferred)
      tau_inline: 0.45         # low bar (inline section, Phase 58 — v1); must be < tau_push
      tau_relevance: 0.5
      min_evidence: 2
      novelty_similarity_max: 0.85
    budget:
      max_pushes_per_day: 3
    feedback:
      step: 0.05
      tau_min: 0.4
      tau_max: 0.85
    relevance:
      episode_lookback_days: 30
      cache_ttl_minutes: 30
```

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `ze_memory` profile / facts / graph | relevance projection |
| Phase 50 preference taxonomy | shared include/exclude semantics |
| `ze_proactive.PushLogStore` | novelty + budget |
| embeddings singleton | novelty similarity |

---

## Test Plan

- Relevance set includes profile topics, explicit preferences, active goals, recent
  episode entities; excludes muted topics.
- Admission admits a signal about an active-goal entity; drops an unrelated low-magnitude
  signal; holds a marginal one in the watch buffer.
- Watch buffer: two marginal related signals jointly cross `τ_admit`.
- Surfacing bar rejects single-evidence hypotheses and low-confidence hypotheses.
- Novelty: a near-duplicate of a recent push is suppressed.
- Budget: pushes beyond `max_pushes_per_day` are stored not pushed.
- Feedback: `not relevant` raises thresholds within clamps; `mute topic` creates an
  exclusion that admission honors next run.
- Every score exposes `contributions` for explainability ("relevant because…").

## Open Questions

- [x] **Initial calibration:** Use conservative defaults (`τ_admit=0.55`, `τ_watch=0.35`
  as specified) plus a `dry_run: true` config flag. In dry-run mode the admission gate
  runs and logs its decision (`admit` / `watch` / `drop`) with the decomposed score, but
  does not write to the graph. This lets thresholds be tuned safely before enabling real
  ingestion.
- [x] **Relevance set storage:** On-demand computation with a short-lived in-process cache
  (`cache_ttl_minutes` from config, default 30 min). No materialized table in v1 — the
  computation is cheap and a stale cache is acceptable within a turn.
- [x] **Global vs per-topic thresholds:** Global thresholds for this phase. Per-topic
  thresholds are a planned future enhancement (see "Future: Per-Topic Thresholds" below).
- [x] **Magnitude normalization:** Per-source z-scoring (decided in Phase 55). Actual
  normalization deferred until the second source lands; news carries `magnitude=0.0` so
  admission is relevance-driven only for now. The admission formula already treats
  `w_magnitude * 0.0 = 0` gracefully.
- [x] **Engagement feedback loop:** Guard against it by capping the engagement weight at
  the same level as profile facets (Medium), never above. If the last 3 user reactions all
  concern the same topic, don't compound — treat subsequent reactions to that topic as
  neutral. Revisit if the "banana" failure mode recurs empirically.

---

## Deferred: Engagement Source

The relevance set spec lists engagement (follow-up questions, reactions to prior pushes)
as a Medium→High weight source with slow decay. It is **not implemented in Phase 56**
because there is no engagement-tracking data yet — pushes are Phase 59 (deferred post-v1)
and there is no follow-up signal infrastructure.

Pick this up when Phase 59 lands:
- Track accepted/dismissed push reactions in `push_log` or a dedicated
  `engagement_signals` table.
- Add `_add_engagement_entries()` to `RelevanceModel` that reads recent reactions
  and weights topics involved in accepted pushes at Medium (0.5), capping the
  engagement weight at the same level as profile facets to avoid the "banana"
  compounding failure mode (see Open Questions above).

---

## Deferred: Graph Centrality Source

The relevance set spec lists graph centrality (entities already richly connected in the
user's graph) as a Low weight source with no decay. It is **not implemented in Phase 56**
because the expected gain is small (Low weight) and the query is non-trivial.

Pick this up in Phase 60+ when signal volume makes centrality meaningful:
- Add a `_add_graph_centrality_entries()` method to `RelevanceModel`.
- Query `memory_graph_relationships` for entities with the highest in-degree
  (`COUNT(*)` where `target_id = entity.id`), normalize to [0, 0.3], and add
  those entities as Low-weight entries.
- Gate the query on `graph_store` being available; skip silently if not.

---

## Future: Per-Topic Thresholds

Global thresholds work for v1 but carry a known failure mode: a high-volume domain (e.g.
finance tickers) can train the global `τ_push` to be too permissive for all domains, or
noise from one domain can desensitize the user to pushes across the board.

When there is enough signal volume to observe this in practice (likely after the finance
and legal sources land, Phase 60+), introduce per-topic threshold overrides:

```yaml
correlation:
  salience:
    per_topic:
      finance: { tau_admit: 0.65, tau_push: 0.70 }   # higher bar for ticker noise
      legal:   { tau_admit: 0.60 }
```

The `RelevanceModel.score` call already returns `contributions` by key; adding per-topic
thresholds means looking up the topic in the override map before applying the global bar.
No data model change is required — only the admission gate logic and config schema change.

This is explicitly **not** in scope for Phase 56. It belongs in the phase that introduces
the second or third signal source.
